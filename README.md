# text to speech
 This system converts text messages into voice 
In this system I used the python library for text to speech conversion called pyttsx3, This module can work even offline. 
Installation
open your terminal and write pip install pyttsx3 and the library will be downloaded and then you are good to go.
To practice download the code and work it out from your computer and have fun.
